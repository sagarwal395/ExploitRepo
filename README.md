# CVE-2023-43494 Exploit

## Overview

This repository contains various resources to exploit and test Jenkins vulnerability CVE-2023-43494. This vulnerability affects Jenkins versions 2.50 through 2.423 (both inclusive), and LTS versions 2.60.1 through 2.414.1 (both inclusive). The vulnerability allows attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain values of sensitive build variables (e.g., password parameter values) used in builds by iteratively testing different characters until the correct sequence is discovered.

## Nuclei Template

The Nuclei template can be used to identify and exploit CVE-2023-43494 in Jenkins

### Running the Nuclei Template

You can run this template using the following command:

```bash
./nuclei -t CVE-2023-43494.yaml -u <username>:<api_key>@localhost:8080 -var project_name=<project_name> -var search_string=<password_to_check> -debug
```
## Python Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

A Python script is included that demonstrates how to exploit CVE-2023-43494. This script can be used to:

1. Create and configure a Jenkins project with a password parameter.
2. Build the project.
3. Verify if the password is exposed by checking the build history.

## Java Codebase for Static Verification

A Java codebase is included in this repository to statically analyze and verify the class responsible for this vulnerability. This can be useful for determining if the issue is present in a particular Jenkins version without needing to run the server.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java codebase using Maven or Gradle.
2. Run the static analysis tools to inspect the classes responsible for handling sensitive build variables.
